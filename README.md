Install the Django code

Installing an official release with pip

Create a new folder and navigate into it. In this folder, you’ll set up a new virtual environment using your command line:

- Set up a virtual environment	python -m venv env

- Activate the virtual environment	source env/bin/activate

Once you’ve created and activated your Python virtual environment, you can install Django into this dedicated development workspace:

- python -m pip install Django

- django-admin startproject <yourprojectname>

- python manage.py startapp <appname>

- python manage.py runserver
